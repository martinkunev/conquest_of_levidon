TODO ? change direction of everything to counterclockwise; currently the y axis is in the opposite direction (and the cross product is negated)
TODO ? rename field to tile
TODO ? make generic data structures be used through code generation (maybe a better solution is to use a union instead of multiple implementations)
TODO ? redesign input functions
TODO make it simpler to check if two players are allies
TODO ? dynamic battlefield size
TODO ? separate constants for BLOCKAGE_WALL and BLOCKAGE_GATE

bugs
	don't allow pawns to attack their own walls (currently only gates are not attacked)
	don't allow attacking if the attacker cannot do damage to the defender (due to weapon and armor type)

surrender can be abused for scouting (this should be renamed and changed)
	report does not handle surrender properly

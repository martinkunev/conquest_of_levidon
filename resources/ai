	collect information for each region
		how important is it
		how much danger there is of it being attacked

	resources buildings should be built in regions with low danger // and big population
	garrison should be built in regions with high danger and high importance
	watch tower should be built where that will reveal new information
	army buildings should be built in reagions with low danger
		distribute buildings between regions; paths: Archery range, Stables, Blacksmith, Workshop

	the most necessary troops should be built close to where they will be needed

	troop production is distributed between regions; unless there is a very high need of troops, it's not necessary to have 2 regions, in the same area, producing the same troops


	building types
		BuildingWatchTower
		BuildingFarm, BuildingIrrigation, BuildingSawmill, BuildingMine, BuildingBloomery
		BuildingPalisade, BuildingFortress
		BuildingBarracks, BuildingArcheryRange, BuildingForge, BuildingStables, BuildingWorkshop

	unit features
		ranged attack
		assault
		fast

	troop movement
		each region states what troops it needs
		troop-training regions train the required troops






	attacking
		if the attacker wins, rating is increased, based on troops lost and region usefulness
		if the attacker loses, rating is descreased, based on troops lost
	defending
		rating is increased if the regions in danger are well defended; once the defense is satisfactory, the rating doesn't increase a lot if more troops are added

	each region determines what troops it needs
	troop orders are evaluated based on how easy that order can satisfy a region's need

----

regions and garrisons are constant on each turn; rating_max for each region and for each region garrison is 1
rating is also given for each surviving troop

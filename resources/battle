// Each pawn is a circle with a fixed radius. The battlefield has fixed size with scale such as to make pawn diameter equal to 1.
// Obstacles are rectangular areas that represent non-passable objects such as walls. The borders of obstacles are parallel to the borders of the battlefield.
// All map objects (pawns and obstacles) are open (their limit points are not part of them), which means they can touch each other.

keep the gate open the whole round if something passes through it; that way good players may find a way to enter a fortress

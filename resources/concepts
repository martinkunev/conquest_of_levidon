key goals of the game include:
	it should be hard to conquer the world
	it is easier to defend than to attack
	it takes a long time to make all regions produce a lot of income and powerful units
	it's expensive to have huge armies
	it's reasonable to develop some regions and not develop others

future goals:
	war should not be the only aspect of the gameplay; diplomacy, economy, trade, etc. should also play a part

battering ram - makes assault conceivable; useful because it can hardly be destroyed by shooters
balista - makes troops inside garrison vulnerable (which often means they have to attack)
ditch - slows down movement
moat - makes battering ram mostly useless
	TODO how to enter the garrison after the wall is destroyed? siege tower?

shooters should be weaker against better garrison

// longbow						2		1F		arrow			barracks, archery range, sawmill
// javelin
// mace
// maul/hammer
// scimitar warrior
// camel rider
// elephant rider

units that attack while moving (quite rare in games)

simple economy (part of the TODO for population)
	each region has a given population; part of it supports the city; the others can be ordered to collect resources
	wood, stone, iron and gold require special buildings to be produced
	there are buildings that allow producing resources more efficiently (e.g. irrigation)
	gold comes from taxes; the population that is not busy collecting resources does not require payment (and results in gold income)
	from the free population one can set the proportion that will collect each of the resources (food, stone, wood, iron); the income is not proportional to the number of people
	food cannot be stocked indefinitely (it rots)
	each controlled region requires gold to be governed and each building requires more gold; as a result regions with low population can cost gold

? windmill
	+1 food
? watermill
	+1 food
? tillage
	food +2
drift mine (requires: mine)
	stone +2
gold mine (requires mine)
	+1 gold
foundry

region-specific characteristics
	wood (required for sawmill)
	ore (required for mine)
	gold (required for gold mine)
	climate (determines production of food and wood; determines water availability)
		water is require for watermill, irrigation, moat, etc.

technologies:
    conservatory
	tillage; crop rotation
    drainage / sewage
	academy / university

trading
	constructions involved: marketplace, roads, port
	trading benefits are determined by population of the region and its neighbors
	roads increase the benefits from land neighbors
	port increases the benefits from sea neighbors (? whatever that means)

scientific development
* invention of gunpowder; new fortresses

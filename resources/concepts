key goals of the game include:
	it should be hard to conquer the world
	it should not be very hard to defend what is under your control
	there is no player order - all players play their turns independently of each other (both on the map and in battles); they don't see the actions of others before the end of their own turn
	computer players have as much information as local (manual) players; no handicap is used to make computers look stronger
	computers value unit strength and don't hardcode it; unit stats can change and computers will still play as adequately

desired effects:
	slow to make all regions produce powerful units
	expensive to have huge armies
	it's reasonable to develop some regions and not develop others

future goals:
	war should not be the core part of the gameplay; diplomacy, economy, trade, etc. should also play a part

simple economy

each region has a given population; part of it supports the city; the others can be ordered to collect resources
wood, stone, iron and gold require special buildings to be produced
there are buildings that allow producing resources more efficiently (e.g. irrigation)
gold comes from taxes; the population that is not busy collecting resources does not require payment (and results in gold income)
from the free population one can set the proportion that will collect each of the resources (food, stone, wood, iron); the income is not proportional to the number of people

region-specific characteristics
	water (required for watermill, irrigation, moat, etc.)
	wood (required for sawmill)
	ore (required for mine)
	gold (required for gold mine)

gold comes from taxes (depending on the population)

----

trading

constructions involved: marketplace, roads, port

trading benefits are determined by population of the region and its neighbors
roads increase the benefits from land neighbors
port increases the benefits from sea neighbors (? whatever that means)

----

units that attack while moving (applicable in many games)

----

battering ram - makes assault conceivable; useful because it can hardly be destroyed by shooters
balista - makes troops inside garrison vulnerable (which often means they have to attack)
ditch - slows down movement
moat - makes battering ram mostly useless

Conquest of Levidon is a turn-based strategic game.

-- Install --
At the moment the game is only tested on Linux but with no or very few changes it should be able to run on any UNIX-like operating system.

Required libraries:

Installation steps:
$ ./configure
	You can use --prefix=... to change the install location
$ make
# make install

-- Uninstall --

# make uninstall

For each user who has started the game, there is a directory with saved games and custom worlds.
~/.conquest_of_levidon
As expected, "make uninstall" will not delete these directories (in case you need them later). You can manually delete these directories, if necessary.

-- Comments --

The game is in early stage of development. For details about future plans, see the TODO document.
Due to my lack of painting skills, current in-game images are very basic. I'm working on improving them.

Any gameplay ideas or contributions to the graphics are welcome :)

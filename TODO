-- bugs --
H	F resolve more of the battle collisions
	two horses blocked during battle (neither attacks an archer) // when they start moving, they collide again
H	if there are too many units on the battlefield, the last ones get placed at (0, 0) and this leads to crashes
	handle too many units on the battlefield properly
H	crash: retreat take effect immediately and if there is only one other player that is computer, its rating_max will be 0
H	either the AI algorithm or the neighbor state graph are buggy
H	F battle report displayed when an empty region is invaded (and taken without battle)
H	who pays building support when the garrison is under siege?
M	pawn trembling (sometimes when it tries to move to a certain position, but another one is there)
M	fast units cannot always catch up with slow units even when they are close enough (seen with light cavalry and peasant)
L	if_init fails on mac (in glXMakeContextCurrent) when used with ssh forwarding

font no longer appears
	use libxft (? it uses freetype and xrender)

-- features --
H	improve map AI
	F fix map AI for the region population feature
	computer map orders are weak
		computer doesn't want to train good units because there are not enough resources; then an income building is constructed and the computer trains worse units
M	improve economy AI
	dismiss troops when resources are not enough
	when sorting regions before setting workers for production, ignore buildings for resources for which there is no shortage
M	handle different screen resolutions better
M	add indicator (e.g. lighted bulb) to mark the players who have completed their turn
M	improve assault AI
		enemy should stay inside garrison when there are shooters
M	balance battles
	improve auto combat
	stamina?
	chance to miss? (in deaths(), randomly choose how many troops did not hit the target)
	battle->...alive is set by battle_retreat for players individually (this should be documented)
M	when there is no local player left fighting in a battle, resolve the battle automatically
M	improve AI
	treating each troop separately when finding local maximum in AI will have bad results
	on the battlefield, the difference between states seems too small (the simulated annealing starts working too late)
		currently the algorithm does pretty much nothing until the local maximum in the end
	improve computer behavior in case of equal armies (the computer should attack when attacking a region and escape when defending a region)
	when shooters attack a melee pawn and there is nowhere to run, the melee should attack back
M	tell local players when they are defeated (use input_report_players())
M	region population
	better food mechanics; food should not be accumulated indefinately
	excess food should lead to population increase
	each building should requires a number of workers to run; exclude them from other tasks
M	town hall building (allows collecting taxes and producing resources)
M	when a target is impossible, set target to the closest possible (e.g. if shooting range is not enough or a position is outside the battlefield)
M	region-specific features (income, population, units, buildings, battlefield)
	use BLOCKAGE_TERRAIN
	population growth
	army recruitment should reduce population
	population loyalty; revolts and civil wars
M	assault towers
M	catapult, balista
	the pawn is told an area which to guard; if an enemy goes into that area, the pawn sets ACTION_FIGHT on that enemy (this may happen in the middle between rounds)
M	network game with SCTP
M	pawn morale
	low morale can make a pawn skip a round or retreat
M	map redesign (map scrolling, roads, water, ships)
	water and ships
		shipyard - building producing transport ships; each ship has a fixed capacity (number of troop stacks) and a fixed speed (distance it sails in one turn)
		troops can set move destination to boarding the ship; at the same turn, the ship can start moving
		the ship can move freely in the water and can moor; if it moors, it cannot move after that the same turn; if the ship is set to moor, the troops will land in the corresponding region
		a moored ship is one that moored or was just produced at the shipyard; troops can board moored ships
		ships are displayed as a single ship on the map; when one clicks, one can see all the ships and the troops in each ship
		// troops on board of ships are stored in troop stacks - one troop stack for each ship
	support map scrolling
	the map is divided into hexagons (with two vertical and four diagonal edges so that up and down are not possible directions (they would look ugly))
	each region spans a number of hexagons; some hexagons may be part of several regions; some hexagons may span the coastline
	each hexagon may contain roads (one bit for each of the 6 directions; between 2 and 4 bits can be set)
	each troop can move by a number of hexagons per turn (troop->unit->map_speed or something like this)
	troops located in the same hexagon are shown together (they form a single troop stack); battles happen when enemy troops are in the same hexagon
	regions are invaded when an enemy enters into a hexagon belonging to a given region
	each region building occupies pre-determined hexagons; the garrison spans four hexagons and uses nearby roads as places to enter/exit; the shipyard is somewhere on the shore
M	sound
M	do something when there is not enough food for all troops (?kill some troops)
M	keyboard support in various places in the interface; mouse support in various places in the interface
M	make formation consistent with the new battle mechanics
M	maybe the bloomery should take from the stone resource
M	improve world loading/saving
	support JSON comments
	support comma after last item
	log (level error) the line on which parse error occurs
	log (level error) when a compulsory field is not present or has the wrong type
	log (level warning) when an optional field has the wrong type; assume the field is not present for the execution logic
	refactor (simplify) the code using these ideas
M	? melee units should go closer to the shooter to prevent them from escaping far enough to shoot
L	add option for shooters to cover larger area while shooting
L	improve error reporting on invalid map
L	improve AI (formation AI, predicting troops in unknown regions, batter map behavior, better battle behavior, etc.)
L	better support for hotseat (choose player names, timer (to limit player turn duration))
L	fast ships, big ships, battle ships; naval battles; ships participating in assault
L	battle: don't allow attacking if the attacker cannot do damage to the defender (due to weapon and armor type)
L	editor: position region neighbors properly
L	retreat can be abused for scouting (25 peasants can go and retreat for 1 food)
	maybe make retreat take some time (1 or 2 rounds); that way only fast units will be able to retreat
	maybe allow retreat only when the pawns are near the border of the battlefield?
	currently attackers retreating from an assault are killed; is this okay?
L	? support splitting troops
L	limited number of shots
L	building destruction and repair
	buildings get damaged after an open battle; garrisons get damaged after an assault
L	armory, swordsman, crossbowman, heavy cavalry, horse archer
L	assault moat
L	trade
L	religions, ethnicities, languages
L	dynamic alliances
L	seasons
L	? buildings should not generate income on the turn they are built
L	? implement exit game while in battle
L	troops of dead players in allied regions remain alive
	they should either die, join the player or become neutral
L	support up to 24 players

? dynamic battlefield size
? deal damage to each pawn escaping from enemy pawns

refactoring
	iterator for troops in a given stack (garrison / owned by player, dismissed, etc.)
	use 'struct point' only for drawing (draw.h) (fix point_eq calls)
		remove struct region dependency on struct point by moving center and location_garrison into location
	? rename image to sprite
	? change direction of everything to counterclockwise; currently the y axis is in the opposite direction (and the cross product is negated)
	? redesign input functions (handling mouse movement is tedious; handling writing should be unified; can I unify the two input functions?)
	? unify ACTION_FIGHT and ACTION_ASSAULT
	store region troops in stacks (like troops on ships); one special stack for garrison
	rename open battle to field battle (the same name can be applied at other places)
	revise user/computer battle input functions: combat_fight, combat_shoot, combat_assault, movement_queue; it should be clear what they do and how they interact
	? rename support to maintenance
	rename if_display to if_render
	? rename WEAPON_ARROW to WEAPON_PIERCING and change archer melee weapon to WEAPON_PIERCING
	rename struct building income to production

-- interface --
M	display a mirror image of enemy troops
	? display an ellipse with the owner below the troop (instead of changing some pixels in the sprite)
M	custom mouse pointer
M	improve player colors
M	flag patterns
M	show troops count, health, etc. only when alt is pressed
M	button input bottom and right coordinates should be exclusive (... - 1)

use stencil buffer when troops images don't fit into their rectangle (and will be on top of other images)

H	battle AI
H	computer doesn't attack regions
H	levidon map
H	allied pawns should detour when necessary
	if there is one fastest pawn, choose one of the tangents of the overlapping pawns and move in this direction
	if there are two fastest pawns, each one chooses a tangent of the other depending on their angle of collision
M	retreat can be abused for scouting (25 peasants can go and retreat for 1 food)
	maybe make retreat take some time (1 or 2 rounds); that way only fast units will be able to retreat
	maybe allow retreat only when the pawns are near the border of the battlefield?
M	editor: position region neighbors properly
M	make formation consistent with the new battle mechanics
M	improve AI
M	better food mechanics; food should not be accumulated indefinately
M	do something when there is not enough food for all units (?kill some units)
M	balance buildings and units
M	assault towers
M	region population; income should be calculated as a function of the population; army recruitment should reduce population
M	region-specific features (income, population, units, buildings, battlefield)
M	error reporting on invalid map
M	map scrolling
M	handle different screen resolutions better
M	keyboard support in various places in the interface; mouse support in various places in the interface
M	don't allow pawns to attack their own walls (currently only gates are not attacked)
M	don't allow attacking if the attacker cannot do damage to the defender (due to weapon and armor type)
M	use a separate thread to calculate computer turns while the local player is choosing what to play
M	better support for hotseat (show animations to each player, warn before changing current player and showing their map, etc.)
M	?deal damage to each pawn escaping from enemy pawns

battle mechanics
	Q: What I want to fix about battle mechanics?
	A: Players have relatively little control on their pawns (only before each turn) so they have to be quite smart on their own; they shouldn't get stuck or deadlock.

	pawn_stop is not intuitive; if two pawns fight, one tries to escape and the other moves in a collision direction with it, the first doesn't escape
	pawn following another pawn stops at a diagonal field
	pawns don't understand how to sidestep other pawns to reach their destination
	pawns of the same player deadlock (seen with peasant and light cavalry)

	-- bugs --
	F distance to obstacles during assault is not calculated properly
	F pathfinding-related crash during assault (heap handling bug)
	memory corruption on next round
	one should be able to tell all troops to go on assault

TODO ? change direction of everything to counterclockwise; currently the y axis is in the opposite direction (and the cross product is negated)
TODO ? rename image to sprite
TODO ? redesign input functions (handling mouse movement is tedious; handling writing should be unified; can I unify the two input functions?)
TODO ? make it simpler to check if two players are allies
TODO ? dynamic battlefield size
TODO ? separate constants for BLOCKAGE_WALL and BLOCKAGE_GATE

-- interface --

custom mouse pointer
improve player colors
player names and flag patterns
support different resolutions

button input bottom and right coordinates should be exclusive (... - 1)

images
	fortress*.png, fortress_gate*.png
	assault indicator on the map

menu
	directory tabs images
	display minimap

battle
	when two pawns from different alliances are next to each other, display red line between them (to show that they are fighting)
	hide mouse pointer during animation
	display round number
	enemy on the gate not displayed during shooting in battle animation
	support showing more pawn stats (not just health)
	new pawn images
	new wall and gate images; open gate image
	fight animation

report
	display minimap
	in battle report, display which players retreated (maybe show white flag)
	group players by alliances and show indicator for the alliance

map
	village image (will be displayed to the left of troops bar)
	more tooltips
	display current month and year
	right clicking on a garrison on the map should be the same as clicking for assault
	indicate on the map which region is selected (maybe with a border around it?)
	show region-specific expenses
	support showing troop stats
	redesign arrows showing troop movement
	improve boxes for field and garrison troops (it's not obvious one can place units there until there are units)

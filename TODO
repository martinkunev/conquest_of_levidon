H	feature	improve AI
			treating each troop separately when finding local maximum in AI will have bad results
			map: improve computer orders
			economy: dismiss troops when resources are not enough
			economy: when sorting regions before setting workers for production, ignore buildings for resources for which there is no shortage
			battle: when there are many units the computer makes very weird moves
			battle: enemy should stay inside garrison when there are shooters
			battle: the difference between states seems too small; currently the algorithm does pretty much nothing until looking for local maximum in the end
			battle: improve computer behavior in case of equal armies (the computer should attack when attacking a region and escape when defending a region)
			battle: when shooters attack a melee pawn and there is nowhere to run, the melee should attack back
			map: predicting troops in unknown regions
			invasion: implement AI
			formation: implement AI
H	bug		battle: pawn trembling (sometimes when it tries to move to a certain position, but another one is there)
H	if		handle different screen resolutions better
H	bug		battle: when there is no local player left fighting, resolve the battle automatically
H	feature	map redesign (map scrolling, roads, water, ships)
			water and ships
				shipyard - building producing transport ships; each ship has a fixed capacity (number of troop stacks) and a fixed speed (distance it sails in one turn)
				troops can set move destination to boarding the ship; at the same turn, the ship can start moving
				the ship can move freely in the water and can moor; if it moors, it cannot move after that the same turn; if the ship is set to moor, the troops will land in the corresponding region
				a moored ship is one that moored or was just produced at the shipyard; troops can board moored ships
				ships are displayed as a single ship on the map; when one clicks, one can see all the ships and the troops in each ship
				// troops on board of ships are stored in troop stacks - one troop stack for each ship
			support map scrolling
			the map is divided into hexagons (with two vertical and four diagonal edges so that up and down are not possible directions (they would look ugly))
			each region spans a number of hexagons; some hexagons may be part of several regions; some hexagons may span the coastline
			each hexagon may contain roads (one bit for each of the 6 directions; between 2 and 4 bits can be set)
			each troop can move by a number of hexagons per turn (troop->unit->map_speed or something like this)
			troops located in the same hexagon are shown together (they form a single troop stack); battles happen when enemy troops are in the same hexagon
			regions are invaded when an enemy enters into a hexagon belonging to a given region
			each region building occupies pre-determined hexagons; the garrison spans four hexagons and uses nearby roads as places to enter/exit; the shipyard is somewhere on the shore
			display minimap
H	if		fortress*.png, fortress_gate*.png
H	if		map: assault indicator image
H	if		map: improve boxes for field and garrison troops (it's not obvious one can place units there until there are units)
H	if		map: troop bar for just battering ram is not displayed on the map (because it's just 1 troop)
H	if		startup image in the menu (cropped game screenshot?)
H	if		battle: display region name during
H	if		battle: display round number and number of rounds until retreat

M	feature	battle: balance battles
			improve auto combat
			stamina?
			chance to miss? (in deaths(), randomly choose how many troops did not hit the target)
M	if		tell local players when they are defeated (use input_report_players())
M	feature	improve economy and population mechanics
			better food mechanics; food should not be accumulated indefinately
			excess food should lead to population increase
			allocate peasants for each building (the building needs people to run it)
			army recruitment should reduce population
			do something when there is not enough food for all troops (?kill some troops)
M	feature	town hall building (allows collecting taxes and producing resources)
M	if		battle: when a target is impossible, set target to the closest possible (e.g. if shooting range is not enough or a position is outside the battlefield)
M	feature	region-specific features (income, units, buildings, battlefield)
			use BLOCKAGE_TERRAIN
			population loyalty; revolts and civil wars
M	feature	battle: assault towers
M	feature	battle: catapult, balista
M	feature	network game with SCTP
M	feature	battle: pawn morale
			low morale can make a pawn skip a round or retreat
M	feature	sound
M	if		keyboard support in various places in the interface; mouse support in various places in the interface
M	feature	make formation consistent with the new battle mechanics
M	feature	improve world loading/saving
			support comma after last item
			log (level error) the line on which parse error occurs
			log (level error) when a compulsory field is not present or has the wrong type
			log (level warning) when an optional field has the wrong type; assume the field is not present for the execution logic
			refactor (simplify) the code using these ideas
M	feature	? melee units should go closer to the shooter to prevent them from escaping far enough to shoot
M	feature	support more than PAWNS_LIMIT pawns on a given location during battle (limited in battlefield_init() and by REPORT_AFTER_X)
M	bug		button input bottom and right coordinates should be exclusive (... - 1)
M	if		battle: ? display a mirror image of enemy troops
			? display an ellipse with the owner below the troop (instead of changing some pixels in the sprite)
M	if		battle: show troops count, health, etc. only when alt is pressed
M	if		custom mouse cursor
M	if		improve player colors
M	if		flag patterns
M	if		battle: display calculated pawn moves (not a straight line)
M	if		battle: fight animation (display which units are fighting)
M	if		battle: hide mouse cursor during animation
M	if		battle: support showing more pawn stats (not just health)
M	if		battle: change image for pawn selection
M	if		battle: think about displaying reachable locations for a pawn
M	if		battle: add battlefield animation indication when an enemy pawn makes a pawn stop (due to collision)
M	if		group players by alliances and show indicator for the alliance
M	if		when there are too many pawns, the report looks awful
M	if		map: place the flag properly
M	if		map: troop movement animation
M	if		map: display current month and year
M	if		map: one should be able to tell all troops to go on assault
M	if		more tooltips
M	if		map: right clicking on a garrison on the map should be the same as clicking for assault
M	if		map: indicate on the map which region is selected (maybe with a border around it?)
M	if		map: improve economy screen to show region-specific expenses
M	if		map: support showing troop stats
M	if		map: redesign arrows showing troop movement

L	if		directory tabs images in menu

L	feature	add option for shooters to cover larger area while shooting
L	feature	improve error reporting on invalid map
L	if		better support for hotseat (choose player names, timer (to limit player turn duration))
L	feature	fast ships, big ships, battle ships; naval battles; ships participating in assault
L	feature	battle: don't allow attacking if the attacker cannot do damage to the defender (due to weapon and armor type)
L	bug		retreat can be abused for scouting (25 peasants can go and retreat for 1 food)
			maybe make retreat take more time (2 rounds?); that way only fast units will be able to retreat
			maybe allow retreat only when the pawns are near the border of the battlefield?
			retreating troops are killed in several cases (comments in the code describe this); is this okay?
L	feature	limited number of shots
L	feature	building destruction and repair

refactoring
	iterator for troops in a given stack (garrison / owned by player, dismissed, etc.)
	use 'struct point' only for drawing (draw.h) (fix point_eq calls)
		remove struct region dependency on struct point by moving center and location_garrison into location
	? rename image to sprite
	? change direction of everything to counterclockwise; currently the y axis is in the opposite direction (and the cross product is negated)
	? redesign input functions (handling mouse movement is tedious; handling writing should be unified; can I unify the two input functions?)
	? unify ACTION_FIGHT and ACTION_ASSAULT
	store region troops in stacks (like troops on ships); one special stack for garrison
	rename open battle to field battle (the same name can be applied at other places)
	revise user/computer battle input functions: combat_fight, combat_shoot, combat_assault, movement_queue; it should be clear what they do and how they interact
	? rename support to maintenance
	rename if_display to if_render
	? rename WEAPON_ARROW to WEAPON_PIERCING and change archer melee weapon to WEAPON_PIERCING
	rename struct building income to production

use stencil buffer when troops images don't fit into their rectangle (and will be on top of other images)

battle mechanics
	pawn_stop is not intuitive; if two pawns fight, one tries to escape and the other moves in a collision direction with it, the first doesn't escape
	pawn following another pawn stops at a diagonal field
	pawns don't understand how to sidestep other pawns to reach their destination
	don't allow pawns to attack their own walls (currently only gates are not attacked)
	don't allow attacking if the attacker cannot do damage to the defender (due to weapon and armor type)

bugs / issues
	computer never trains army and sometimes never builds some buildings

surrender
	? rename surrender
	surrender can be abused for scouting
	report does not handle surrender properly (no troops displayed for surrendered players)

TODO ? change direction of everything to counterclockwise; currently the y axis is in the opposite direction (and the cross product is negated)
TODO ? rename field to tile
TODO ? redesign input functions
TODO ? make it simpler to check if two players are allies
TODO ? dynamic battlefield size
TODO ? separate constants for BLOCKAGE_WALL and BLOCKAGE_GATE
